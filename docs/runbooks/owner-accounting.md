# Owner accounting of the agencies (epic E06, feature F05)

How CasaZen keeps the accounts of the owners an agency manages: the approved rule sets and the fiscal profiles of the owners (E06/F05/US02/T01), the
append-only owner ledger, the statement versions and the month-end close (T02), the external invoice references that replace the old agency invoices
(E06/F01/US02/T05) and the payouts with their tax evidence (T03). Requirements NF-25, NF-109, NF-110; ADR-012, ADR-017, ADR-018, ADR-019 (amended).

## Product boundary

- **A rendiconto is not an invoice.** The owner statement is a management report («Rendiconto gestionale - non è una fattura»): no fiscal series or
  number, never FatturaPA XML. CasaZen issues **no agency-to-owner invoice**: when the agency invoices its fee, its own external fiscal system issues the
  invoice and CasaZen only keeps a reference to it (see «External invoice references»).
- **Legal and accounting review is a launch gate.** Every rate, applicability rule, tax code and retention period is data of a rule set approved by a
  qualified accountant; nothing is inferred from a country or written in the code.

## Rule sets and fiscal profiles (E06/F05/US02/T01)

- **Rule set** (`OwnerAccountingPolicy`, `api/owner-accounting/policies`): jurisdiction (`IT`, `CH`, `CH-TI`...), rule code, version, validity, the
  official source (an `https` address and the SHA-256 of the document) and the parameters (`OwnerAccountingRuleParameters`): `withholdingApplies`,
  `withholdingRatePercent`, `withholdingTaxCode`, `requiresAgencyCollection`, `requiresQualifyingShortLet`, `grossBaseComponents`, `rounding`
  (`half_up` or `half_even`), `retentionYears`. A rule set is used only once the approval of the qualified accountant is recorded
  (`POST …/{id}/approve` with `approvedByName`); an approved rule set never changes: a change is a new version.
- **Fiscal profile** (`OwnerFiscalProfile`, `api/owners/{id}/fiscal-profiles`): effective-dated (a new profile ends the one in force the day before;
  profiles never overlap), with the kind of the owner, legal name, tax residence, legal address, fiscal code, VAT number, foreign tax id, settlement
  currency, bank account, mandate role and dates, revenue recognition, expense and commission model, working capital rule, tax jurisdiction and the
  rule set it follows. No SDI code or PEC: the profile is not an invoice recipient.
- **Privacy (ADR-012).** Legal name, legal address, identifiers and bank account are encrypted at rest (`Casazen.OwnerFiscalProfile`); the API answers
  them masked (`••••1234`) to `agency.owner.view` and in full only to `agency.owner.financial.manage` (owner and administrators), whose reads are logged
  with ids, never values.
- **Readiness for a day** (`IOwnerFiscalProfileService.ResolveAsync`, `GET …/fiscal-profiles/readiness?date=`): one complete profile in force and its
  approved rule set in force on that day, of the same jurisdiction, or a precise 422: `owner_fiscal_profile_missing`, `owner_fiscal_profile_incomplete`
  (with the `fields`), `owner_fiscal_policy_missing`, `owner_fiscal_policy_not_approved`, `owner_fiscal_policy_not_effective`,
  `owner_fiscal_policy_jurisdiction_mismatch`. A Swiss profile follows its Swiss rule set and can never be given an Italian one.

### Official sources to pin (operator, with the accountant)

Record each in the rule set (`sourceUrl`, `sourceSha256`) before approving it: the FatturaPA documentation and schema (`docs/runbooks/fiscal-documents.md`),
the guidance of the Agenzia delle Entrate on the withholding of short lets (art. 4 D.L. 50/2017 and the provisions in force), the ESTV guidance on VAT and
accounting for Swiss owners, and the retention law that applies (Italy at least ten years; Swiss immovable-property evidence can require twenty).
