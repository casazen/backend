# Owner accounting of the agencies (epic E06, feature F05)

How CasaZen keeps the accounts of the owners an agency manages: the approved rule sets and the fiscal profiles of the owners (E06/F05/US02/T01), the
append-only owner ledger, the statement versions and the month-end close (T02), the external invoice references that replace the old agency invoices
(E06/F01/US02/T05) and the payouts with their tax evidence (T03). Requirements NF-25, NF-109, NF-110; ADR-012, ADR-017, ADR-018, ADR-019 (amended).

## Product boundary

- **A rendiconto is not an invoice.** The owner statement is a management report («Rendiconto gestionale - non è una fattura»): no fiscal series or
  number, never FatturaPA XML. CasaZen issues **no agency-to-owner invoice**: when the agency invoices its fee, its own external fiscal system issues the
  invoice and CasaZen only keeps a reference to it (see «External invoice references»).
- **Legal and accounting review is a launch gate.** Every rate, applicability rule, tax code and retention period is data of a rule set approved by a
  qualified accountant; nothing is inferred from a country or written in the code.

## Rule sets and fiscal profiles (E06/F05/US02/T01)

- **Rule set** (`OwnerAccountingPolicy`, `api/owner-accounting/policies`): jurisdiction (`IT`, `CH`, `CH-TI`...), rule code, version, validity, the
  official source (an `https` address and the SHA-256 of the document) and the parameters (`OwnerAccountingRuleParameters`): `withholdingApplies`,
  `withholdingRatePercent`, `withholdingTaxCode`, `requiresAgencyCollection`, `requiresQualifyingShortLet`, `grossBaseComponents`, `rounding`
  (`half_up` or `half_even`), `retentionYears`. A rule set is used only once the approval of the qualified accountant is recorded
  (`POST …/{id}/approve` with `approvedByName`); an approved rule set never changes: a change is a new version.
- **Fiscal profile** (`OwnerFiscalProfile`, `api/owners/{id}/fiscal-profiles`): effective-dated (a new profile ends the one in force the day before;
  profiles never overlap), with the kind of the owner, legal name, tax residence, legal address, fiscal code, VAT number, foreign tax id, settlement
  currency, bank account, mandate role and dates, revenue recognition, expense and commission model, working capital rule, tax jurisdiction and the
  rule set it follows. No SDI code or PEC: the profile is not an invoice recipient.
- **Privacy (ADR-012).** Legal name, legal address, identifiers and bank account are encrypted at rest (`Casazen.OwnerFiscalProfile`); the API answers
  them masked (`••••1234`) to `agency.owner.view` and in full only to `agency.owner.financial.manage` (owner and administrators), whose reads are logged
  with ids, never values.
- **Readiness for a day** (`IOwnerFiscalProfileService.ResolveAsync`, `GET …/fiscal-profiles/readiness?date=`): one complete profile in force and its
  approved rule set in force on that day, of the same jurisdiction, or a precise 422: `owner_fiscal_profile_missing`, `owner_fiscal_profile_incomplete`
  (with the `fields`), `owner_fiscal_policy_missing`, `owner_fiscal_policy_not_approved`, `owner_fiscal_policy_not_effective`,
  `owner_fiscal_policy_jurisdiction_mismatch`. A Swiss profile follows its Swiss rule set and can never be given an Italian one.

### Official sources to pin (operator, with the accountant)

Record each in the rule set (`sourceUrl`, `sourceSha256`) before approving it: the FatturaPA documentation and schema (`docs/runbooks/fiscal-documents.md`),
the guidance of the Agenzia delle Entrate on the withholding of short lets (art. 4 D.L. 50/2017 and the provisions in force), the ESTV guidance on VAT and
accounting for Swiss owners, and the retention law that applies (Italy at least ten years; Swiss immovable-property evidence can require twenty).

## Owner ledger and month-end close (E06/F05/US02/T02)

- **Ledger** (`OwnerLedgerEntry`, append-only): every line has a stable idempotency key (source, type, owner and amounts), its source (payment, booking,
  charge, wire batch, manual) and document, the service, recognition and payment dates, the property, the effective ownership and share, the original
  and the statement currency with the rate, its source and date, the tax code and the rule version (`{ruleCode}@{version}`), and a signed amount
  (positive = owed to the owner). `AppDbContext` refuses to save a change or a removal of a line (409 `owner_ledger_immutable`); a correction is a
  reversal (`ReversesEntryId`, at most one per line) plus a replacement line.
- **Posting** (`POST api/owner-accounting/periods/{y}/{m}/post`, `agency.statement.manage`): idempotent. Sources: the completed payments (net of refunds;
  the share in force on the payment day; recognized on the payment day, or on the check-out for a profile whose recognition rule is `stay`), the mandate
  commission on that share, the channel commission of an active booking whose payments are gross (`OtaCommissionIncludedInPayments`, with its first
  payment), the approved charges (`OwnerCharge`, one-time or monthly, to one owner or split by the shares), the wires marked paid. The shares are split
  in the source currency, rounded half to even, the last owner (by id) taking the remainder; then converted with the agency's rate (`OwnerFxRate`,
  `api/owner-accounting/fx-rates`, the rate of the day or of the 7 days before; CasaZen fetches none). Changed facts reverse the old line and post the new
  one; a closed month of an owner is left as it is.
- **Versions** (`OwnerStatementVersion`): `POST …/periods/{y}/{m}/owners/{id}/versions` cuts the ledger now and stores the totals by type, the opening and
  closing balance and the SHA-256 of the lines; `Flagged` with a blocking readiness issue, else `Draft`; the version before becomes `Superseded`. A line
  posted after the cut-off marks the month dirty (`OwnerClosePeriod.IsDirty`): no approval, publication or close until a new version. Approval
  (`…/versions/{id}/approve`, `agency.statement.manage`) and publication (`…/publish`, `agency.statement.publish`) are distinct permissions; publication
  stores the JSON of the version and of its lines with its SHA-256 (`…/published`), kept after it is superseded. `GET …/versions/{id}` drills down to the
  lines and their sources.
- **Readiness** (`GET …/periods/{y}/{m}/readiness`): org issues `ownership_missing`, `ownership_share_gap`, `source_amount_missing`; owner issues from the
  fiscal profile (`owner_fiscal_*`), `fx_missing`, `unposted_source`, `duplicate_entry`, `currency_mixed`, `statement_missing`, `statement_not_approved`,
  `ledger_statement_imbalance`, `negative_balance`, `period_dirty`.
- **Close** (`POST …/owners/{id}/close`): on the last version, approved or published, the approved closing balance against the wires marked paid for the
  owner's statements of the month (same currency). A difference or a negative balance blocks (422 `owner_close_unreconciled` with `due`, `paid`,
  `difference`) unless `waiverReason` is given by a caller with `agency.owner.financial.manage` (otherwise 403 `owner_close_waiver_forbidden`); the
  waiver, its author and time stay on the month. A closed month is never posted or versioned again; its corrections go into a later month.
- **Retention and legal hold**: at the close the month keeps its jurisdiction, years (the larger of the rule set's `retentionYears` and the floor: Italy
  10, Switzerland 20, others 10) and `RetainUntil` (31 December of the close year plus the years). `…/legal-hold` (`agency.owner.financial.manage`,
  with a reason) stops the expiry (`OwnerRetention.MayPurge`). No job deletes anything yet. `GET …/evidence` exports the month: the close, every version
  with its published file, the lines and their charges.
- **Corrections** (`POST api/owner-accounting/corrections`, `agency.owner.financial.manage`): a signed manual line with its reason; `replacesEntryId`
  reverses an earlier manual line first. A line of a source is corrected by fixing the source and posting again.
- **Scope**: the endpoints need an org-wide reach; a collaborator restricted to some properties gets 403 even with the permission.
- **Not yet**: the import of the outgoing bank movements (a wire marked paid is the evidence of the transfer), the payouts of T03 in the reconciliation.
